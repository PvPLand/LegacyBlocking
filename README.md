# Legacy Blocking (Fabric)

A lightweight Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.4 that reverts the block-hitting mechanics to behave like they did in version 1.8. This mod is perfect for players who miss the classic block-hitting experience during combat.

## Features

- **Swing Progress Restoration**: When blocking with a sword, the swing progress is no longer canceled, allowing for smoother and more accurate blocking animations.
- **Equip Animation Removed**: The equip animation (the item rising up) is disabled when blocking with a sword, closely mimicking the 1.8 block-hitting behavior.

## Compatibility

- **Minecraft Version**: 1.21.4+
- **Mod Loader**: Fabric
- This mod is client-side only.

## Installation

1. **Install Fabric**:
   - Download and install the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net/).
   - Download the appropriate version of the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for 1.21.4.
2. **Download the Mod**:
   - Get the latest release of the mod from the [Releases](#) section.
3. **Add to Mods Folder**:
   - Place the mod's `.jar` file and the Fabric API `.jar` file into your Minecraft `mods` folder.
   - The `mods` folder is usually located in `.minecraft/mods`.
4. **Run Minecraft**:
   - Launch Minecraft using the Fabric profile.

## How It Works

This mod restores the block-hitting behavior from Minecraft 1.8 by:

- Preventing the cancellation of the sword's swing progress when blocking.
- Removing the rendering of the equip animation when the sword is raised to block.

These changes ensure that blocking feels smooth and responsive, just like in the classic PvP days.
